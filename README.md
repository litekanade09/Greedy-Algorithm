This section explores the Greedy Algorithm technique, a problem-solving approach that makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment.

Definition and Approach: Explained greedy algorithms as strategies that build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

Key Characteristics: Discussed the essential characteristics of greedy algorithms, including local optimality, which may lead to a global optimum for some problems but not all.

Common Examples: Illustrated classic problems solved using greedy algorithms, such as the Coin Change Problem, Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms for Minimum Spanning Trees, and the Activity Selection Problem.

Performance Analysis: Analyzed the efficiency of greedy algorithms, highlighting their generally faster execution time compared to exhaustive search methods, while noting that they do not guarantee an optimal solution for every problem.

Practical Applications: Provided real-world applications of greedy algorithms in fields such as resource allocation, scheduling, and network design.
